;;; Commentary:
;; Publication of Org source files to reveal.js uses Org export
;; functionality offered by org-re-reveal and oer-reveal.
;; Initialization code for both is provided by emacs-reveal, e.g.,
;; in the Docker image emacs-reveal: https://gitlab.com/oer/docker
;; Org-re-reveal and oer-reveal are also available on MELPA.
;;
;; Use this file from its parent directory with the following shell
;; command:
;; emacs --batch --load test-cases/publish.el

;;; Code:
(package-initialize)

;; Prefer most recent version of org-re-reveal from parent directory
;; over the one embedded in emacs-reveal:
